      <div>EFFECTIVE DATE: 08/05/2024</div>
      <br>
      <div>PAYMENT POLICY</div>
      <div>When you place an order, you will never be asked to input any financial information or make any online
        transactions. Instead, you will receive a unique code for that order. This requires you to input an email
        address into our website. We do not accept social media messages, phone calls, or text messages. You will
        receive a new code for each order. This code will help your order be identified. <span class="bold">We accept
          only cash.</span> </div>
      <br>
      <div>If you do not have your code, we will not be able to receive payment or give you your order. <span
          class="bold">Do not forget your code.</span> We will not be able to give you a new one for your order.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Additionally, in the email containing your order code, we will confirm your order, provide a pickup time and
        location, and show you the final price. <span class="bold">If you do not have this amount, we will not give you
          any part of your order.</span> </div>
      <br>
      <div>LATE POLICIES
        <div>Because our transactions are in-person, this creates the risk of tardiness or absence. If your order is not
          on time, we will refund you one dollar for every business day that we do not deliver it to you. </div>
        <br>
        <div>If you do not arrive at the pick-up location within ten minutes of the agreed time, we reserve the right to
          leave the pick-up location. The first time this occurs, you will receive a warning, but you will not be
          charged. However, if this happens more than once, <span class="bold">we will charge you one dollar for every
            business day you do not come to pick up your order</span>. </div>
        <br>
        <div>If you contact us at least 2 business days prior to the agreed pick-up time, you are exempt from this
          policy. You must state your order code clearly in your message. Be sure that the order code is correct. If it
          is not, we will not be able to identify your order. If you are unable to come to the pickup location because
          of a sudden emergency, contact us as soon as possible. We will not charge you in this circumstance. If we find
          that your reason is not valid, we will still charge you. For example, if you say you did not arrive at the
          location because you went on vacation, we will still charge. </div>
        <br>
        <div>To schedule or reschedule the pickup of your order, we will contact you with a new pickup time and/or
          location. You will receive the new time and location at least 3 business days prior. The location of the
          pickup is non-negotiable. You may contact us to arrange a new time. You must contact us at least 2 business
          days prior to the previously arranged time. For example, if we contact you and give you Friday, March 15th as
          a pick up date, you must contact us as late as the end of the business day on Wednesday, March 13th. We will
          negotiate a new time that works for you and us. If you do not contact us in advance, we will charge you one
          dollar for every business day you do not come to pick up your order.</div>
        <br>
        <div>If you do not arrive at the pickup location at the agreed time and/or do not contact us in advance three
          times for the same order, we may refuse to give you your order. A sudden emergency or a rescheduling does not
          count. If you do not arrive repeatedly throughout multiple orders, we also may refuse you service for an
          extended period of time.</div>
        <br>
        <div>COMPLAINTS</div>
        <div>We want to create a safe environment for not only our customers, but also ourselves. If you behave
          inappropriately to a facility member of Interfolded, they will have the ability to refuse to give you your
          order and report you. We will contact you soon after, and will ask you for justification. If you do not
          provide it or we feel that it is not reasonable, we will continue to refuse you service. You may provide this
          at any time. Prior to this, you will not be able to make or receive any orders. If you do provide reasonable
          justification, we will send you a new time of delivery. </div>
        <br>
        <div>On the other hand, <span class="bold">if you feel that a facility member treats you inappropriately, please
            contact us immediately.</span> Include your order code, a description or the name of the facility member,
          and an accurate description of the situation. Be as specific as possible! Our facility members are also
          required to give you their name on request. </div>
        <br>
        <div>If your order is incorrect, contact us as soon as possible so we can replace any missing items. Include an
          image of all of the items you received in your order and your order number. Without it, we will not be able to
          validate your concern. You will be able to keep any items that you did not order and you will be refunded 30%
          of what you paid. </div>
        <br>
        <div>If you find any errors on our website, contact us as soon as possible. If you are the first to report a
          valid issue, we may provide you compensation. </div>
        <br>
        <div>YOUR PRIVACY</div>
        <div><span class="bold">When placing your order, you will be required to give us your email.</span> This allows
          us to send you your order code. This, as well as any other information we might receive from you, will be kept
          confidential. We do not require you to put in any identifying information. Additionally, we will never
          disclose the information of your orderâ€™s pick up time and location. </div>
